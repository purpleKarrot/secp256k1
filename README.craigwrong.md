# `secp256k1` Library - Craig S. Wrong's Fork

I forked the original Bitcoin Core's library to add:

 - A `Dockerfile` with build procedures for various configurations.
 - A shell script to target macOS and package as XCFramework.

This way the library can be used in Swift projects using Swift Package Manager (SPM) on both Mac and Linux platforms.

PRs welcome. If you need to contact me just DM me at `twitter.com/notcraigwright`.
